> Execute and manage loop engineering primitives from an AI coding session.

## What this skill does

This skill wraps the `bin/loop` CLI from
[ai-workspace](https://github.com/ulises-jeremias/ai-workspace), exposing loop
operations to AI coding agents without requiring the user to remember CLI flags.

**Loop engineering** is the practice of designing recursive, autonomous processes
that prompt AI agents — as opposed to prompting agents directly. Loops have
durable state (`STATE.md`), safety gates (allowlist/deny), cost budgets, and
rollout tiers (L1 report-only → L2 PR-gated → L3 unattended).

## Capabilities

| Subcommand | When to use |
|-----------|-------------|
| `loop init <pattern>` | Scaffold a new loop from a starter |
| `loop run <loop>` | Execute one loop iteration |
| `loop status` | Show all loops: tier, cadence, last run |
| `loop audit [loop]` | Summarize past run success/cost |
| `loop cost <loop>` | Estimate per-run token cost |
| `loop sync` | Push escalations to knowledge/todos |

## How to invoke

```bash
# Check if ai-workspace loop CLI is available
dots-loop status

# Or invoke directly
~/.ai-workspace/bin/loop status
```

## Routing

1. Check if `~/.ai-workspace/bin/loop` exists → use it
2. Otherwise check `AI_WORKSPACE_LOOP_BIN` env var
3. Otherwise: guide the user to install ai-workspace

## Rules

1. **Always start at L1** for new loops. Only graduate to L2/L3 after reviewing
   at least 3 consecutive clean L1 runs.

2. **Budget awareness** — report the estimated cost before running an expensive
   loop (pr-babysitter, ci-sweeper). Confirm with the user.

3. **Allowlist enforcement** — never take an action not in the loop's
   `allowlist`. If uncertain: escalate (`human_escalation` exit condition).

4. **Worktree hygiene** — loops create isolated git worktrees. Clean them up
   on success; preserve on failure for postmortem.

5. **Escalation first** — when in doubt, choose `human_escalation` over
   guessing. The user can always re-run.
