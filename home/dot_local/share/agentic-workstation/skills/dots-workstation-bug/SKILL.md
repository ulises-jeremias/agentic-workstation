# Bug (WHAT)

Use for defects that can be handled through the normal development workflow.

## Bug vs incident rule

Route to **`dots-workstation-incident`** instead if the problem impacts production or live users now, degrades service, blocks critical business operations, creates client-reported urgency, or needs immediate response outside planning cycles.

## Default guardrails

1. Apply **`dots-workstation-output-handshake`** before final output.
2. Capture reproduction steps and environment details.
3. Use **`clickup-cli`** for ClickUp writes only after approval.
