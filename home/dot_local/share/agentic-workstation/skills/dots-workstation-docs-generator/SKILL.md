# Docs Generator (WHAT)

Generate or refresh documentation from the actual code, schema, and git history.
Never invent — always derive from evidence in the repo.

## When to use

- README is missing, stale, or doesn't reflect the current stack
- CHANGELOG needs to be generated from merged PRs or git log
- API spec (OpenAPI/GraphQL) exists but human-readable docs don't
- New repo needs an AGENTS.md to onboard AI assistants

## Out of scope

- Does NOT write code — documentation only
- Does NOT commit or push — delegate to **`github-cli-workflow`**
- Does NOT update external systems (Confluence, Notion) — use their respective skills

## Workflow

### README.md generation

1. Inspect repo: `package.json` / `pyproject.toml` / `Cargo.toml` for name, description, stack
2. Read `Makefile` / `justfile` / `package.json scripts` for commands
3. Read `.github/workflows/` for CI structure
4. Draft README with: Purpose, Stack, Prerequisites, Quick Start, Development, Testing, Contributing
5. Apply **`dots-workstation-output-handshake`** before writing

### CHANGELOG.md generation

```bash
# Conventional commits format
git log --oneline --no-merges --pretty="format:%h %s" $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)..HEAD

# Group by type: feat / fix / docs / chore / refactor / perf / test
# Format: ## [Unreleased] with subsections per type
```

Draft changelog section and ask user to confirm version before finalizing.

### API reference generation

- OpenAPI spec → readable endpoint table with params, responses, auth
- GraphQL schema → type reference with fields and descriptions
- Always note the spec version and date in the generated doc

### AGENTS.md starter

Use the template from `~/.local/share/agentic-workstation/skills-catalog.yaml` patterns:

- Purpose and stack
- Repository inspection order
- What AI assistants may and must not do
- Key commands (build, test, lint)
- Links to key docs

## Anti-patterns

- Do not guess stack or commands — read from actual config files
- Do not generate CHANGELOG from unstaged changes
- Do not overwrite existing README without showing diff first

## Delegates to

| Need | Skill |
|------|-------|
| Push and create PR with generated docs | **`github-cli-workflow`** |
| Confirm output destination | **`dots-workstation-output-handshake`** |
| Repo discovery | **`dots-workstation-assistant`** |
